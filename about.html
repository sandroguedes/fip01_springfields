				<h2>MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the Spring Fields, London's largest residential complex to date. Here we are ready to provide our tenants and buyers with the best standards of the real estate market, combined with affordable prices and excellent service.</p>
				<p>It all started in 1985, when the founding members of a small real estate office decided to create what they liked to call "A city within a city" with a heavy focus on sustainability. On that same year, we annexed a few neighboring companies and founded the Spring Field Group -an enterprise large and powerful enough to make this dream a reality.</p>
				<img class="about_image" src="images/FIP-About-IMG01.png" alt="">
				<p>Throughout our growth, we've stayed committed to upholding the same principles our company was founded on: providing residents with affordable, sustainable, petfriendly and secure housing with the same standard of care and professionalism expected of the best companies within this segment.</p>
				<p>To make all that possible, all our apartments are built into a single complex thruoughout its numerous 12 story buildings that are spread out in between parks, gardens and recreational areas. At the forefront of it all, Spring Fields also counts on a small mall where its residents and visitors can find all sorts of ammenities like a food court, drugstore, supermarket, offices for dentists and optometrists and a discount store.</p>
